# AirGuardian App

Decentralized air quality monitoring system: Real-time air quality data collection and visualization from IoT sensors deployed in various locations.

## Description

### Introduction

Air pollution is a global issue that affects millions of people, causing numerous health problems and contributing to climate change. To address this challenge, AirGuardian has been developed as a groundbreaking decentralized air quality monitoring system. Combining the power of the SWAN Stack with Svelte, Arweave Wallet, and ARConnect, AirGuardian offers a secure, scalable, and user-friendly solution for real-time air quality data collection, analysis, and visualization. In this article, we'll explore how AirGuardian works, its key features, and how you can contribute to the platform using Raspberry Pi and air quality sensors.

### How AirGuardian Works

AirGuardian leverages the SWAN Stack, replacing Next.js with Svelte to build a fast and responsive web application. The platform uses Streamr for real-time data transmission, Warp Contracts for device authentication and data validation, and Arweave for permanent data storage. Additionally, Arweave Wallet and ARConnect are utilized for secure user login and data management. This powerful combination of technologies enables AirGuardian to provide a comprehensive and transparent solution for air quality monitoring.

### Svelte Integration

Svelte is an innovative open-source web development framework for building fast and responsive applications. By using Svelte instead of Next.js, AirGuardian developers can create a lightweight and high-performance web application that ensures a seamless user experience while accessing real-time air quality data.

### Arweave Wallet and ARConnect Integration

AirGuardian uses Arweave Wallet and ARConnect to provide a secure and user-friendly login system. Arweave Wallet allows users to manage their AR tokens and interact with the Arweave network, while ARConnect is a browser extension that streamlines the process of connecting to the wallet. By integrating these technologies, AirGuardian ensures a secure and straightforward login experience while maintaining user privacy and data ownership.

### Upcoming Raspberry Pi Tutorial

AirGuardian is committed to fostering a community-driven approach to air quality monitoring. To help users contribute to the platform, a comprehensive tutorial on setting up Raspberry Pi devices with air quality sensors to be integrated using Streamr is coming soon. This tutorial will guide users through the process of setting up their Raspberry Pi devices, connecting air quality sensors, and transmitting the collected data to the AirGuardian platform. By empowering users to deploy their own monitoring devices, AirGuardian aims to create a truly decentralized and global network of air quality data.

### Key Features of AirGuardian

- Real-time air quality monitoring: AirGuardian collects and displays real-time data on air quality parameters such as particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone levels from IoT sensors deployed across the globe.

- Secure and decentralized data management: AirGuardian leverages blockchain technology to ensure data security, privacy, and tamper-proof storage. Data validation and device authentication are managed through Warp Contracts, while Arweave provides permanent data storage.

- User-friendly web application: The AirGuardian web application, built with Svelte, offers an intuitive and responsive interface for users to visualize and analyze air quality data.

- Community-driven approach: AirGuardian encourages users to contribute to the platform by setting up their own air quality monitoring devices, fostering a decentralized and collaborative approach to air quality monitoring.

### Conclusion

AirGuardian is revolutionizing the way we monitor and understand air quality by harnessing the power of decentralized technology. With its innovative combination of the SWAN Stack, Svelte, Arweave Wallet, and ARConnect, AirGuardian offers a secure, scalable, and user-friendly platform for real-time air quality data collection and analysis. By providing the tools, resources, and community support necessary to create a global network of air quality monitoring devices, AirGuardian is paving the way for a cleaner, healthier future for everyone.
